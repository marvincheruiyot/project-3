5.1.If the Buyer shall fail to take and or pay for the Goods within fourteen days after written notification by the Seller that the Goods are ready for delivery, the Seller shall be at liberty to treat the contract as repudiated by the Buyer, and thereupon the deposit shall be forfeited and any sums paid by the Buyer shall be returned less a sum equivalent to a reasonable administration fee, any damages, loss or expenses which the Seller may have suffered or incurred by reason of the Buyer’s default (including as a result of selling such vehicle at a lower value) and/or storage costs and the Seller shall be under no further liability to the Buyer. <br><br>
